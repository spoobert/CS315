When a new munch is generated there is a chance the munchie will spawn inside the snakes body. Once the body leaves the cell
the snake is in the munchie will vanish from the screen but it will still be on the board.  So the snake may consume
the munchi by passing over the invisible munchie.  However there is a chance that after consuming this rogue munchie the snake
head will be teleported somewhere else within the gameboard.  Other wise the game works as intended.
